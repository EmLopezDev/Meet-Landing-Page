## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS custom properties, functions, and mixins
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

-   Getting more comfortable with responsive layouts, I do need more practice but I still feel good about where I am.
-   How to add an overlay on an image with a color like on the footer of this project.
-   Have a better grasp on the `::before` selector on CSS, had to use it to add the line on the numbered dividers.

### Continued development

-   I still need more practice on layout responsiveness. It's getting easier but I still want to do more until it becomes second nature.
-   Choosing the right size to make elements is still something I want to work on because I feel I take too long trying to figure it out.

### Useful resources

-   [Clamp Calculator](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - This helps with making font-sizing responsive
-   [Utopia, Fluid Design](https://utopia.fyi/clamp/calculator?a=320,1240) - This helps better calculater sizing and responsiveness.
